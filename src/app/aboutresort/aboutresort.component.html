    Pragati Green Resorts is a one-of-its-kind resort in the country - it is a man-made Eco-village developed on barren land creating a natural habitat. The environment here is completely Eco-friendly, abundantly bio-diverse, pollution-free and mosquito-free. It makes for the most welcoming destination for recreation, event and health in the lap of nature.Having converted a non-usable land into a wonderful green belt on 2,500 acres of land without any chemical pesticides or fertilizers, we have been attracting rare species and contributing to biodiversity. Situated amidst 2.5 million mother plants and trees, the Resort is an 85 acre sprawl of greenery till the end of sight. It is an ideal retreat for the aware, creative and playful nature-lover.While you could spend a vacation plucking aromatic herbs for your tea and swimming in the pool with birds singing around, your whole family and group will be able to find their own interests. The resort property houses everything from cricket fields, golf course and naturopathy spa to ponds filled with ducks and lovely sculptures and fountains every few meters.
